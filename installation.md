# Module 2 First-Time Software Installation

## Conda Environments

Install conda environments required for the rest of module. Go to the `environments` folder and then go to `python_3_11` folder; create the conda environments based on the `environment.yml` file. Each `yml` file is prefixed with the environment name.

For example, to create the `bde` environment, first navigate into the `environments/python_3_11` by running `cd environments/python_3_11`, then run the following command:

`conda env create --file bde-environment.yml`

To replace an existing environment:

`conda env update --file bde-environment.yml --prune`

### Environments

Create all the environments in the `environments/python_3_11` folder at this point.

Here is where the environments will be used:

- `bde`: Lesson 2.1 onwards
- `elt`: Lesson 2.5 onwards
- `dagster`: Lesson 2.6 onwards
- `ooc`: Lesson 2.7
- `kafka`: Lesson 2.10

Please prepare your environments before each lesson. Reach out to your cohort of Discord if you have any questions.

### For Windows WSL Users

If you get an error message when creating the `bde` environment, e.g.

> ERROR: Could not build wheels for thriftpy2, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects.

Run the following CLI command from your terminal:

`sudo apt install build-essential`

The learner is first requested to install docker via this link before running the below commands:

### Docker Setup

- Windows users: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/
- Mac users: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/

> WSL user can install the Windows version. You need not install docker in your wsl environment.

### Docker Launch

- We will launch docker image from the terminal in Docker app.

> WSL user can use Windows command prompt to run the docker command.
